        16: ('Why must He be a true and righteous man?',

             'prophets, and foreshadowed by the sacrifices and other ceremonies '
             'of the law. Finally, He had it fulfilled through His only Son.'),
        20: ('Are all men, then, saved by Christ just as they perished through '

             "salvation, out of mere grace, only for the sake of Christ's "

             'Father, Son, and Holy Spirit?',
